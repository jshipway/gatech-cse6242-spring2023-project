## Georgia Tech CSE 6242 - Data and Visual Analytics - Spring 2023 Project

# To run web application:

Once you clone the repo, cd into the dataManagement directory.

Once in that directory run:

python itineraryBuilderService.py

This will bring up the new combo web server and app server on port 80.   

If you start this up on your computer, you would then access this from a browser via http://localhost   

If you want to bring everything up on a different port, say 3000, just type:

python itineraryServiceBuilder.py 3000

Then you would access the application via http://localhost:3000
